        <p>At TableSolutions, we strive to create the best gaming experience for tabletop board games. To improve the classic method of accessing and playing these types of games, we have created a unique table that allows the user to save on space and access
            their games from anywhere in the world. Our table provides a more immersive playing experience and allows the user to quickly and easily load any game or map and start playing without the hassle of finding and setting up the board game and
            its pieces. This table functions in the same way as any other table you might use with one major improvement; it has a screen embedded inside the middle of the table. This screen can be used to display the board or map for the game that you
            want play. The screen is sunk into the table so that when it is not in use, the table can be used as a normal table. The screen is covered up by a solid piece of wood so that the table is durable and sturdy, as well as keeping the screen protected
            from any damage that may occur.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">We have developed three sizes of tables that will fit in multiple spaces and accomadate anywhere from 4-10 players. Choose from any of the three sizes and rest assured knowing that your table is of the highest quality and will last for years of
            enjoyment. Visit our accessories page to purchase accessories for your table that add to the experience. Check out the games page to view available games for purchase that can be played on your table. Sign up for an account to register your
            table, purchase games, and access and play them from anywhere. Enjoy board games again with TableSolutions!
